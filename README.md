This app shows a list of items in a collection view and their details. 

On iphone/ipad(portrait mode), a blank screen appears first you have to press the back button to make list of files appear.

I have used UISplitViewController, this works as Master and Details View Controller.

MasterViewController is used to create a list of items and when a item is tapped it's detail appears in DetailViewController
